This site exists because it was fun to make and I wanted a site that arghyaguha.com, a domain i have owned for a while, points to.

It doesn't exist because I have anything to sell or am looking for work. I have a [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guha-arghya/) for the latter.

However, if you do want to reach out, click on one of the social icons on the right or the "about" page to know more about me.
