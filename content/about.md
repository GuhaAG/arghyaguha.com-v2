I am a software engineer living in Tokyo, Japan.

I have been living in Japan since 2016 before which I spent a few years in Singapore where I had moved straight out of my hometown - Kolkata, West Bengal, India - after graduating from the University of Calcutta with a Masters (M.Sc.) and a Bachelors (B.Sc.) in Computer Science.
